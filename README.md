### Build full-stack web3 applications with ease

Shell is an easy-to-use command-line tool that simplifies the process of building web3 applications. Similar to a web application, which has a frontend and a backend, a web3 application features a smart contract that resides on a blockchain and a frontend that interacts with this smart contract. Use `hardhat` to write and deploy smart contracts to the blockchain. Use `svelte` to develop frontends for deployed smart contracts. Additionally, `GPTpy` is provided as an auxiliary tool to assist with any learning curves new programmers might encounter.
